## Introduction
In this project I created a working CHIP-8 emulator/interpreter. It's written in C, utilizing SDL2 library. 

## Dependencies
The only dependency for this program is SDL2.

## Installation
**Disclaimer!** Remember to meet the dependencies before running the program.
### Executable
To run the emulator, simply download correct file from *Releases* page.
### Source (Linux)
To build from source, clone this repository and create a *build* directory inside. From there, run these commands:
1. `cmake ..`
2. `make`

The executable will be there :)
